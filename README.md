Hello this repo includes all the assessment phases
================================================================
For the last phase, the project uses node.js and express.js as a proxy server to call the api since it did not work on the frontend side. The frontend uses webpack and axios to bundle everything up
----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the final phase
```bash
cd phase_three_exercises/backend/
node index.js
```
Open the index.html file 

In order to run the TCL oode
```shell
cd phase_three_exercises/tcl_exercise/
tclsh index.tcl
```
