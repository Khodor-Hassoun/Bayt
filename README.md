Hello this repo includes all the assesment phases
================================================================
For the last phase, the project uses node.js and express.js as a proxy server to call the api since it did not work on the frontend side. The frontend uses webpack and axios to bundle everything up
----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the project
```bash
cd phase_three_exercises/backend/
node index.js
```
